    "# Shifted Window Attention Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the model to effectively process input data, the feature maps are padded before applying the attention mechanism. This is necessary to ensure that the feature map dimensions are divisible by the window size, as the model operates by partitioning the input into non-overlapping windows, and padding ensures that all elements are considered. After padding, the feature map is divided into windows, allowing attention to be computed within each window. This step prevents potential distortions that could occur if the window sizes were not uniform and ensures stable operation of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to address the issue of a few pixel pairs dominating the self-attention mechanism when the model size increases, the method of **scaled cosine attention** is proposed. Instead of computing attention using the standard dot product of the query and key vectors, attention is computed using the cosine similarity between these vectors. This similarity is then scaled by a learnable parameter $\\tau$, which is different for each head and layer. This scaling helps control the magnitude of the attention values, ensuring the stability of the model, especially in larger versions. The formula for computing the similarity between pixels $i$ and $j$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\\text{Sim}(q_i, k_j) = \\frac{\\cos(q_i, k_j)}{\\tau} + B_{ij}\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $q_i$ and $k_j$ are the query and key vectors, and $\\tau$ is the learnable scaling factor. An important addition is $B_{ij}$, which represents the relative position bias. This bias is added to account for the relative positions of pixels within the window, allowing the model to better handle varying window sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the relative position bias $B_{ij}$ plays a key role in improving the attention computation. Unlike the fixed positional encoding used in traditional transformers, this bias is computed dynamically for each pair of pixels based on their relative positions within the window. Introducing **relative position bias** into the attention formula enables the model to be more adaptive when working with images of different resolutions and window sizes, improving its performance and stability.\n",

    "# Relative Position Embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, **relative position bias** is introduced as a mechanism to handle varying window resolutions effectively. The traditional approach to relative position bias, which directly optimizes parameterized biases, can become problematic when transferring models across different window sizes. To address this, the paper proposes a **log-spaced continuous position bias approach** that can be smoothly transferred to fine-tuning tasks with arbitrary window sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to use a **meta network**, denoted as $G(\\Delta x, \\Delta y)$, which generates bias values for relative coordinates. Instead of directly optimizing biases, this network computes biases based on the relative positions of elements in the window. In this way, the generated biases can be adapted to different window sizes without requiring retraining. The continuous position bias approach allows the bias values to be precomputed and stored as model parameters, making inference efficient and consistent with the original parameterized bias approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the paper addresses the challenge of **extrapolating biases** when transferring models across significantly different window sizes. The original approach used linearly spaced coordinates, which led to large extrapolation ratios. To mitigate this, the paper introduces **log-spaced coordinates**, which reduce the required extrapolation when transferring biases across window resolutions. The transformation from linear coordinates $\\Delta x, \\Delta y$ to log-spaced coordinates $\\Delta cx$, $\\Delta cy$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
